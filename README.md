## Introduction


### Abstract

We believe social networks have significant benefits for people and society. 

However, the big social networks suffer from major problems: data breaches, fake accounts, poor accountability, rife advertising, and restricted rights; these problems harm people and society. 

We propose a social network plan that aims for social good, as a not-for-profit (NFP), using free/libre open source (FLOSS).

### About

We want to explore the viability of new social network for social good.

We want to explore the purpose (i.e. why try this?) and pragmatics (i.e. how to do this?).

We want this to be a friendly introduction that invites discussion.

We welcome feedback and suggestions: use [issues](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/social_network_plan/issues), or email joel@joelparkerhenderson.com, or tweet [@joel_henderson](https://twitter.com/joel_henderson).

This plan is a work in progress and likely to change as we learn more.

We edit for active present tense, and edit quotations lightly for content and anonymity.


### Context

We are looking at the biggest social networks such as 
[Facebook](https://facebook.com),
[Twitter](https://twitter.com),
[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com).

We like websites that use technology for social good such as 
[Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org),
[Craigslist](https://craigslist.org),
[Archive.org](https://archive.org).

We look to foundations such as 
[Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)](http://eff.org/) and
[Free Software Foundation (FSF)](http://fsf.org).

We admire FLOSS groups such as 
[Open Source Initiative (OSI)](http://opensource.org/) and 
[Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC)](https://sfconservancy.org/).

We use social coding sites such as 
[GitHub](https://github.com) and
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com).

We use social identity tools such as 
[GPG](https://www.gnupg.org/) and
[Keybase](keybase.io).

We admire distributed social networks such as
[Mastodon](https://mastodon.social) and
[Patchwork](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork).

<!--
Original content vs. resharing

* "Reshares are part and parcel of a community - even before the days of the Internet. For many, gossip is part of socializing. A friend posted that he's just getting married. People will want to spread the word. How can they without reshares? Rewrite it themselves? Resharing is simply part of usual human interaction."

### How to describe a social network?

We see challenges in how people describe social networks; we suggest starter questions.

Examples:

* **Benefits**: give me reasons to try your product.
* **Privacy**: what is your privacy policy, including sharing with 3rd party?
* **Platform**: is your product aiming to be a platform, API, plugin, integation, etc.?
* **Access**: mobile, web, desktop, native, etc.?
* **Code**: open source, closed source, etc.?
* (more?)
