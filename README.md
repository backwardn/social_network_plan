<img src="README.png" width="300" height="180" alt="Social network icons">


## Abstract

We believe social networks have significant benefits for people and society. However, the big social networks suffer from major problems: data breaches, fake accounts, poor accountability, rife advertising, and restricted rights; these problems harm people and society. 

We want to explore the viability of new social network that aims for more social good. This document is a request for comments and ideas about funding, audiences, scopes, niches, security, and more.
