# Funds: advertisements, donations, subscriptions?

Discussing potential funds, such as who pays for the social network, using ideas such as advertisements, donations, subscriptions.

Example quotations to consider:

  * "The incentives created by an advertising business model are to essentially addict people psychologically to your product, and then to cause outrage cycles. You want to feed them stuff that either makes them afraid or angry, because when they’re excited by low level emotions like that, they share more stuff, they’re more active, they spend more time on the site, and see more ads, and they’re just more valuable to them."

  * "Subscription sounds like it might be a good idea because it seems like it would remove the incentive to monetize personal information, but in practice it creates a barrier to adoption and makes the social network kind of useless."
