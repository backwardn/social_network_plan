## Disclosure policies


### Coordinated disclosure 

Coordinated disclosure, sometimes a.k.a. responsible disclosure, explains how people can report potential security issues, and work together to address the issues.

### Dropbox

Dropbox is publishing a security disclosure policy, and also blogging about it.

* https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/03/protecting-security-researchers/

Excerpts:

* 1. A clear statement that external security research is welcomed.

* 2. A pledge to not initiate legal action for security research conducted pursuant to the policy, including good faith, accidental violations.

* 3. A clear statement that we consider actions consistent with the policy as constituting “authorized” conduct under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).

* 4. A pledge that we won’t bring a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA) action against a researcher for research consistent with the policy.

* 5. A pledge that if a third party initiates legal action, Dropbox will make it clear when a researcher was acting in compliance with the policy (and therefore authorized by us).


## Conduct policies

Conduct policies, a.k.a. code of conduct agreements, explain how an organization expects people to interact, and how to use group norms to provide better collaboration, more respect, and happier participants.
