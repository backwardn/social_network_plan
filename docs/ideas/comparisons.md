# Comparisons: similarities & differences versus others?

[Issue discussion](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/social_network_plan/issues/4)

Discuss comparisons, similarities, and differences versus other social networks and other social network plans.


### Quotations

Quotations to consider:

* "The social startups that have struck it big in the post-Facebook era have all started by carving out a different niche. That difference can’t just be about a site’s back-end architecture or business model, as with Diaspora (an open-source Facebook) or App.net (a Twitter without ads). The product itself has to fulfill a fresh purpose for its users, like sharing snazzy smartphone snapshots (Instagram), networking and advancing their careers (LinkedIn), or showing off their taste in fashion, food, and design (Pinterest)."


### Example ideas

Example ideas from real people to consider:

Similarities to many existing social networks:
* I want a profile photo, like on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.
* I want to post an item, such as a status update, or photo, or link.

Differences from many existing social networks:
* I want to use a pseudeonym, not my real name.
* I want a personal page and a professional page.
* I want ways to do more locally, e.g. like NextDoor.
* I want to promote my small business to neighbors.

Versus Twitter:
* I want a longer username, not limited to 15-characters.
* I want long posts.

Versus Facebook:
* I want separation e.g. peers vs. news, work vs. home, family vs. friends.
* I want a pin area so I can feature my current interests e.g. links to music.
* I want to share with groups of people e.g. circles.
* I want more ways to shape my feed, e.g. more photos of friends, fewer photos of food.
* I want fewer ads and/or more-relevant ads.

Versus LinkedIn:
* I want to be able to apply for jobs more easily.
* I want to feature my skills, rather than feature my resume or CV.
* I want to follow company news, yet not get overwhelmed.
* I want to automatically connect to all my coworkers e.g. enterprise address book.
