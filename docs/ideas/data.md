# Data: who owns it, who uses it, who controls it?

[Issue discussion](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/social_network_plan/issues/6)

Discuss data areas, such as who owns data, who uses it and how, who controls it and where it goes?

### Quotations

Quotations to consider:

* "We want to put you in control — and be transparent about what information we have and how it is used."

### Data collection

Data collection ideas to consider:

* IP address - can help with routing, langauge localization, etc.

* Browser and operating system information

* The address of the website or app you’re using

* Cookies and device identifiers - can help us determine whether you’re signed in or not

Data collection reasoning:

* IP addresses help us list the countries where people are using an app.

* Browser and operating system information enable us to give developers information about the platforms people use to access their app. 

* Cookies and other identifiers help us count the number of unique visitors, and help us recognize which visitors are our users, so we can provide aggregated demographic information, like age and gender, about the people using the site.


### Data for adversting

Data helps us enable websites and apps to show ads from our advertisers. 

* When we get a request to show an ad, we need to know where to send it, and the browser and operating system a person is using. 

* Cookies and device identifiers help us determine whether the person is our user. If the person is our user, then we can use the fact that they visited a business’s site or app to show them an ad from that business or a similar one. If the person isn't our user, then we can show an ad encouraging them to sign up.

* An advertiser can choose to add our pixel, which is some computer code, to their site. This allows us to give advertisers statistics about how many people are responding to their ads — even if they saw the ad on a different device — without us sharing anyone’s personal information.


### Data for security

Receiving data about the sites a particular browser has visited can help us identify bad actors. 

* Example: if someone tries to log into your account using an IP address from a different country, we might ask some questions to verify it’s you. 

* Example: if a browser has visited hundreds of sites in the last five minutes, that’s a sign the device might be a bot. We’ll ask them to prove they’re a real person by completing additional security checks.


### Data for improving Our Products and Services

Data helps us improve the content and ads we show. 

* Example: if you visit a lot of sports sites that use our services, then you might see sports-related stories higher up in your News Feed. 

* Example: if you visit a lot of travel sites that use our services, then you might see ads for travel packages, plane flights, and hotels.


### Data controls

We give you a number of controls over the way this data is used to provide more relevant content and ads.

* We require websites and apps who use our tools to tell you they’re collecting and sharing your information with us, and to get your permission to do so.

* News Feed preferences lets you choose which content you see first and hide content you don’t want to see in your feed. You can also view your News Feed chronologically instead of ranked by what Facebook predicts you might be most interested in.

* Ad preferences shows you the advertisers whose ads you might be seeing because you visited their sites or apps. You can remove any of these advertisers to stop seeing their ads.
In addition, you can opt out of these types of ads entirely — so you never see ads on Facebook based on information we have received from other websites and apps.

* If you don’t want us to use your interests to show you ads on other websites and apps, there’s a control for that too.
