# Topologies: centralize, decentralize, distribute, federate?

[Issue discussion](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/social_network_plan/issues/12)

Discuss potential topologies of the social network, such as whether it is essentially centralized (as are Facebook and Twitter) or decentralized/distributed/federated (as are Mastodon and Secure Scuttlebutt).


### Quotations

Quotations to consider:

* "The only way social is going to work and be improved going forward is through decentralisation and taking our data out of the hands of a central repository where it can be used to target us, and is more vulnerable to breaches. Once we have that baseline the other problems can be solved by the communities themselves."

* "The web that many connected to years ago is not what new users will find today. The fact that power is concentrated among so few companies has made it possible to weaponize the web at scale."

* "The whole issue with the first decentralised networks at the moment are their usability and accessibility to the average person. Thereâ€™s a lot of work to be done on this. There are 1000s of people tackling the problem globally from the protocol level to the user interfaces."


* "Social protocols are the answer. They probably won't be the first answer. You need some of these networks with real traction (or at least one huge one) so they can derive a protocol from the greatest common factors between them. To preemptively make a protocol sans popular implementation has little value and often ends in low adoption. As we've learned, the success of a protocol is more about its popularity than its presence or quality. So I say let these networks gestate and once the market (of people, not money) starts picking winners, then begin your abstraction. And for those (of us) working on solutions to this problem space now, keep going. You don't need a committee or standards doc or whatever. You just need an awesome implementation."

## Considerations

Do distributed social networks exacerbate the problems that Facebook has been seeing so much backlash against?


### API exploits

The Facebook Cambridge Analytica issue was caused by APIs that are too open. 

Question: For distributed systems, are there more ways to exploit the APIs and gather data on users?


### Accountability

There is a clear issue with Facebook's accountability. 

Distributed run on multiple servers, with multiple owners, and may also be open source.

Does this lead to any areas of zero accountability?


### GDPR

How does a distributed system do GDPR compliance?


### Usability

Some of the problems with Facebook are more about usability and clarifying how things work to users, for instance the scandal with people giving away access to their private messages.

Open source software and distributed software tends to be much harder to use.

How to make an open source and/or distributed social network easier to sue?


### Future-proofing

Will any future concern/issue be harder to resolve if there are many different instances running decentralized social networks?


### Security

Using AI to detect abusive content or spot fake news is much harder if you only have a subset of the data. 

Does it becomes harder to address these concerns in a distributed setting?
