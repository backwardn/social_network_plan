# Audiences: general public, niche groups, special needs?

[Issue discussion](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/social_network_plan/issues/2)

Discuss ideas for audiences, such as the general public, or niche groups, or special needs of people.

Example quotations to consider:

* "The social startups that have struck it big in the post-Facebook era have all started by carving out a different niche. That difference, Cross argues, can’t just be about a site’s back-end architecture or business model, as with Diaspora (an open-source Facebook) or App.net (a Twitter without ads). The product itself has to fulfill a fresh purpose for its users, like sharing snazzy smartphone snapshots (Instagram), networking and advancing their careers (LinkedIn), or showing off their taste in fashion, food, and design (Pinterest)."
